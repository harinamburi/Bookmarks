Here's an attack vector:

1) Set up a honeypot that detects Nexpose Security Console scans/attacks (in someway).
2) Once I get a probe, fire back a logout request.
3) Continue to logout the active user forever.

It's less damaging than a traditional "hack back" but is sure to irritate the local red team to no end. It's essentially a user DoS. This attack may have been useful as a denial of service against AppSpider instances, allowing an attacker to prevent normal AppSpider usage.
